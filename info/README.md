## Description
*So you made a videogame that hid the things you were trying to exhibit?! Had some doubts but released it anyway?! Now you're trying to crawl back in with a different version that lets the audience see the Unity GameObject menu brought to life?! No, wait, that's me! Enjoy it if you can!*

*v r <sup>2</sup>* is a remake of [*v r 2*](https://www.pippinbarr.com/v-r-2/info) in which I make the objects actually visible.
