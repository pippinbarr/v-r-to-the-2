## Description
*v r <sup>2</sup>* is a remake of my previous game [*v r 2*](https://www.pippinbarr.com/v-r-2/info) (2016) in which I "exhibited" objects from Unity's `GameObject` menu by hiding them inside default cube objects in a gallery setting.

Now that I'm older and wiser, I've come to feel that hiding the objects was a bit too cute (I was thinking about the artist Gregor Schneider at the time, for what it's worth) and that it would have been better to make the objects visible. So, *v r <sup>2</sup>* is that game: it's *v r 2* with all the objects moved up out of the cubes to rest on top of the cubes, that's why the "2" is raised. GET IT???

## History
As above, the key point about *v r <sup>2</sup>* is that it's a straightforward remake of [*v r 2*](https://www.pippinbarr.com/v-r-2/info) but with the exhibited objects made to be visible again.

I was at a conference in Kingston, Ontario called *Museums Without Walls* and gave a talk about *v r 2* among other things. In doing so I was forced to constantly reassess the game and to try to justify my hiding of the objects in the cubes. I couldn't really justify it in the end (and admitted as much in my talk), then realised I could just *make the game again*! So when I got home I duplicated *v r 2* and essentially just "moved everything up a bit" to make it visible. (Obviously it was a bit more complex than that in a few places, but that's the gist.)

And here we are, a whole new game.

## Technology
*v r <sup>2</sup>* was created in Unity (2021.3.7f1 LTS if you really care about those things). It uses the excellent [Gold Player](https://github.com/Hertzole/gold-player) character-controller by Hertzole.
